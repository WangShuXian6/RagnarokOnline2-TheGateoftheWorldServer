Saga Preview Version Readme

This is a preview version of the Saga server program(Revision:718). The purpose of releasing
this version is to increase awareness of the project, and give people 
the ability to debug their own scripts/db.

Since RO2 is still in it's beta stage and we don't want to see any negative
effect on RO2 through our program, we have decided to set some limitations
so people can only use our software for testing rather than for hosting a private RO2 server.
Due to the encryption of the binary in this release, the performance of saga might
be slower than usual.

Note: Saga requires the .NET framework version 2.0!

You can find some Documentation about quickstart under the Documentation folder,
although it's already a little bit outdated.

This preview version is for educational/test purposes only, and has severval 
limitations(You won't be able to host an RO2 server).
For RO2 and Saga's future, please don't try to crack it.

IMPORTANT!!!
We don't support any kind of client modification!!
So DO NOT ask any client related questions!

Some notes about the DB implementations; currently only the MySQL binding is
working 100%. MSSQL binding is outdated and untested, and in the dat binding(if you 
don't have MySQL you may try use this) the mail and auction systems
are not working, but all other functions should be working correctly.

For Scripting tutorials please see our Forum.
